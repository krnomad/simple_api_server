# simple_api_server

Based on `fastapi`, this is the source of building a simple API server using `sqlalchemy` and `DI`.

Creating CI/CD using github action and distributing it based on container is also a goal to guide.

Aims to build an API sample test environment with ultra-simple commands

# pre requirements
* Install docker
* Install docker-compose

# Get started
```
docker-compose up -d
```
